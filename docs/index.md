## Quick Words

Kairoi is a **Time-based Job Scheduler**. It works as a server allowing its clients to schedule jobs to be executed in the future, using a simple text protocol (read more about the protocol in the [Kairoi Client Protocol documentation](client-protocol.md)).

Once the job execution time is past, Kairoi automatically triggers a job execution on a matching configured runner (read more about runners in the [Kairoi Runners documentation](runners.md)).
